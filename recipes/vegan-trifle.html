        <li>75g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>a pinch turmeric</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the cream:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>250ml whippable plant cream</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>To make the sponge, heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and oil and line a 20cm square or round cake tin with parchment. 
            Mix the vegetable oil, vanilla paste, lemon juice and plant milk in a jug. Tip the baking powder, caster sugar and flour into a large bowl. 
            Make a well and slowly whisk in the vegetable oil mixture until smooth, then spoon into the prepared tin and bake for 30-40 mins until golden and a skewer 
            inserted into the middle comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, make the compote. Put the raspberries, sugar, lemon and 50ml water in a small pan, bring to a simmer and cook for 4-6 mins until the fruit 
            breaks down a little to a sauce. Remove and set aside to cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>To make the custard, put the cornflour in a bowl and add a splash of the cold plant milk, and stir until lump-free. Pour this mixture into a saucepan with 
            the remaining ingredients, including the rest of the milk, and cook over a low heat for 6-8 mins, stirring often, until you get a thick custard that coats the back 
            of a spoon thickly. Cover the surface with a piece of parchment and set aside to cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>To assemble, cut the sponge into squares or fingers, and place in the bottom of a trifle dish. Spoon over the compote, then add 150g of the raspberries. Give the 
            cooled custard a brief whisk, then pour over the top of the raspberries. Chill for 1-2 hrs until the custard has set.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whip all of the ingredients for the cream together until you get soft peaks (it's best to taste the cream for sweetness before adding the icing sugar), and spoon 
            over the top of the set custard. Chill until ready to serve. Scatter with the remaining raspberries, mint, almonds and a dusting of icing sugar to decorate, if you like.</p></li>
